# ohms-law-calculator

A simple Python program to calculate Voltage, Current, or Resistance using **Ohm's Law**.

Ohm's Law formula:  
V = I * R

Where:  
- **V** = Voltage (Volts)  
- **I** = Current (Amperes)  
- **R** = Resistance (Ohms)

## Features

- Calculate **Voltage**, **Current**, or **Resistance** by entering the other two values.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Easy to modify and extend.
